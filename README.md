# 📊 Institutional Explainable AI Dashboard

An enterprise-grade, institutional decision-support platform for professional stock analysis and prediction. This project transforms raw market data into actionable, transparent, and risk-aware insights using advanced AI models.

## 🚀 Minute-by-Minute Technical Breakdown

### 1. High-Level Architecture
- **Frontend**: A high-performance React application built with **Vite** for rapid development and **Vanilla CSS** for premium, glassmorphic UI aesthetics.
- **Backend**: A robust **Express (Node.js)** server handling API requests, data aggregation, and orchestration of AI logic.
* **Database**: **MongoDB** for secure user authentication and historical data storage.
- **AI Core**: Advanced simulation models (LSTM/Transformer-based logic) that generate forecasts with confidence intervals.

### 2. Core Dashboard Components (Deep Dive)

#### 🛡️ Executive Summary & Insights
- **Sentiment Ticker**: Real-time processing of news headlines to provide immediate market context.
- **Summary Cards**: Key performance indicators (Expected Return, Confidence, Volatility) summarized for quick executive decision-making.
- **Strategic Insight Panel**: AI-generated narratives explaining *why* a specific action (Buy/Hold/Sell) is recommended.

#### 📈 Advanced Forecasting
- **Prediction Chart**: Interactive time-series visualization showing historical data followed by a probabilistic future forecast.
- **Market Audit Table**: A granular, line-by-line breakdown of historical price points versus AI-predicted future values.

#### ⚖️ Risk & Portfolio Management
- **Risk Heatmap**: A sophisticated 2D visualization plotting **Volatility vs. Model Confidence**, identifying "Sweet Spots" for low-risk/high-confidence entries.
- **Portfolio Allocation**: Dynamic capital allocation suggestions based on confidence scores and inverse volatility to optimize returns.
- **Bullish/Bearish Console**: A pros and cons list generated by the AI to provide a balanced view of any stock ticker.

#### 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI) & Ethics
- **Reasoning Console**: Breaks down the decision-making factors (e.g., historical trends, technical indicators, volume shifts) into transparent percentages.
- **Model Disagreement Indicator**: Simulates multiple AI models (LSTM vs. Transformer) and flags warnings if the models reach conflicting conclusions.
- **Responsible AI Layer**: Implements safety checks and ethical constraints to ensure the AI doesn't recommend high-risk gambles outside of institutional parameters.

### 3. Step-by-Step Backend Process
1. **Signal Intake**: Receives ticker symbols and user-defined parameters (Volatility Shift, Base Price, etc.).
2. **Data Processing**: Fetches/Simulates real-world market distributions.
3. **AI Inference**: Runs the data through prediction models to generate the 30/60/90-day horizon.
4. **XAI Computation**: Calculates feature importance and disagreement scores.
5. **JSON Delivery**: Sends a comprehensive data packet back to the frontend for real-time UI updates.

# JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
npm run start
```

#### **Frontend Setup**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
